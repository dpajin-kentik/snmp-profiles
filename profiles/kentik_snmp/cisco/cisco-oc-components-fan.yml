        # Represents the state of a device being monitored. Valid values are: 
        # normal(1): the environment is good, such as low temperature. 
        # warning(2): the environment is bad, such as temperature above normal operation range but not too high. 
        # critical(3): the environment is very bad, such as temperature much higher than normal operation limit. 
        # shutdown(4): the environment is the worst, the system should be shutdown immediately. 
        # notPresent(5): the environmental monitor is not present, such as temperature sensors do not exist. 
        # notFunctioning(6): the environmental monitor does not function properly, such as a temperature sensor generates a abnormal data like 1000 C.
